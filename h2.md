### x) Read/watch/listen and summarize. (In this x-subsection, you don't need to do tests on a computer: just reading or listening and a summary is enough. A few bullet points are sufficient for the summary.)

OWASP Top 10: A01 - Broken Access Control

Summary (bullet points):
- Broken Accees control occurs when users can access resources or actions they shouldn't.

Common causes: 
-  Missing authorization checks on the server.
-  relying on client-side controls (hidden fields, URLs).
-  IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References).

Examples: 

- Accessing /admin without being admin.
- Changing URL parameters like ?user_id=1.

Impact: 
- Data leaks.
- Privilege escalation.
- Account takeover.

Prevention:

- Enforce access control on the server.
- Deny by default.
- Use centralized authorization logis.

Reflection: 

This vulnerability is common because developers oftern assume "users won't guyss URLs".

### Karvinen 2023: Find hidden web directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf:

Summary:

- Directory fuzzing finds hidden paths like /admin, /staff, /backup.
- ffuf sends many HTPP requests using wordlist.

Example ideas: ffuf -u http://targetFUZZ -w wordlist.txt

Helps discover: 

- Admin pnales.
- Old backups.
- Restricted pages without proper access control.

### PortSwigger: Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation:

Summary:

- Access control must be necessary on the server.
- URL-based restrictions are weak.
Privilege escalation:
- Horizontal: user --> another user
- Vertical: user --> admin
Common mistakes:
- Trusting cookies or hidden fields.
- Missing checks on backend routes

### Karvinen 2006: Report writing (in Finnish)

Summary:

Clear structure is critical:

- goal
- environment
- steps
- results
- conclusions
- write in a way that another person can reproduce your work
- screenshots and commands improve credibility

### PortSwigger: What is SQL Inhection:

- SQL injection happens when user input is directly integrated into SQL queries.
Attackers can:
- bypass login
- extract data
- modify database content
Prevenetd by
- Input validation
- parameterized queries

### a) Break into 010-staff-only. See Karvinen 2024: Hack'n Fix

In this excersice the gaol was to access a page meant only for staff wuthout credentials. For this excersice I followed the instructions on this page: https://terokarvinen.com/hack-n-fix/  .
