# h1 Command and Concure
### 
In this homework, I apply an Infomration Security Management System (ISMS) to my home
network. The task is to define what is included and excluded, indetify key parties and 
connections and link them to ISO/IEC 27001 in a clear and auditable way.

#### a) Baseline - ISMS Scope for home network

Definition of ISMS Scope:

To explain it in a easiest way ISMS Scope mean the limits of your information security systems.
What is protected? Where is it protected? Who is included? And it clearly states what's inside and what's outside
of the security system. The scope includes the technical infrastructure, devices, information assets and services that 
I own or directly control and that are used for learning, lab work and related administrative activities.


#### a1) What is included in scope?

##### Home network infrastructure: 

- Home router, firewall and WI-FI access points.
- Internal home network for study/labs.
- Network security controls.


##### Study and lab devices: 

- Personal laptop used for course and labs.
- Virtual machines used practice.
- Local practice servers running on the workstation or virtual machines.
- Phone used for multi-factore authentication to access cloud services.

##### Information assets: 

- Course material and lecture content.
- Own notes and documentation.
- Lab datasets and configuration files.
- User accounts, credential, cryptographic keys related to studies, API keys.

##### Supporting services: 

- Backup services for study data
- Cloud services used for coursework (GitHub)
- Learning Management systems (LMS) of the educational institution (Moodle)

#### a2) What is excluded and why?

##### Out of scope assets:

- Smart TV, game consoles (play station).
- Employer-managed devices.
- ISP (Internet Service Provider) infrastructure beyond the home router.

Justification for exclusion:

- These assets are not owned or administratively controlled by me.
- ISP infrastructure is outside my authority and responsibility.

#### a3) Key interfaces:

- Internet boundary: Home router/firewall are separating the internal network form the public internet.
- Remote access: SSH into lab Virtual Machines
- Cloud services: GitHub, cloud storage, LMS platfomrs accessed over HTTPS.
- Suppliers: ISP, cloud service providers

#### b) Tie it to ISO 27001 - Interested Parties

#####
I picked "interested parties" for my home network. For each party I explained three things:
- Their need/ expectation/requirement (security, privacy or availability)
- Which part of ISO 27001 it relates to (context, leadership, planning, operation, performance evaluation or improvement).
- Showing evidence that I meet this needs

Interested parties 
- Me (system owner and student)
- Educational institution
- Cloud service providers
